Script compares different types of files in different ways:
1. Compare images - separate method compares images by pixels. If number of pixels for both image files 
is the same - the method prints that Image files are the same and vise versa.
2. Compare archive files - separate method compares archive files by size. If size of both archive files 
is the same - the method prints that archive files are the same and vise versa.
3. Compare text files - separate method compares text files by content. If content of both text files 
is the same - method prints that text files are the same. If the names of the files are same and content is different
- the method prints that text files are different. 

Script validates if file exits in directory
